# README: Predictive Model for Classifying Police Activity Based on Noise Levels

## Objective:

The objective of the code is to classify police activity based on noise events using hourly data. It's implemented in Python using pandas for data processing, Pytrends to get Google Trends data, and Scikit-learn for machine learning tasks.

## Code Description:

The code can be separated into four main sections:

1. **Data Gathering and Processing**
2. **Merging and Feature Engineering**
3. **Model Building**
4. **Evaluation and Model Saving**

Please note that this code requires the pandas, numpy, scipy, pytrends, sklearn, and holidays libraries. If you don't have these libraries installed, you can do so using pip:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy scipy pytrends sklearn holidays
